Description: 
  Reads and writes data frames to 'SQLite' databases while 
  preserving time zones (for POSIXct columns), 
  projections (for 'sfc' columns), units (for 'units' columns), 
  levels (for factors and ordered factors) and classes for 
  logical, Date and 'hms' columns.
  It also logs changes to tables and provides more informative error messages.
